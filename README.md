**THEME:**
**Central Question: Where are the voters?**
With the next presidential election coming up we came upon some inspiration. We were reminded of the political climate of the 2020 presidential election. We wanted to see how many people were registered to vote in North Carolina. With a statewide focus, looking into all 100 counties in the state of North Carolina registered to vote, we see not only the percentage of votes each candidate received, but also the percentage of registered voters who participated in 2020. We want to see how many registered voters are in each county and what political party is that county affiliated with for the past presidential election. There will be a table showing not just to the two primary candidates, but all other possible candidates for the 2020 election.

**Pillars of Focus**:
Number of registered voters in each county of North Carolina
Percentage of registered voters in each county who participated 
Breakdown of the major political parties in the 2020 election

**Ethical Consideration**: 
We reviewed the datasets to ensure there were no personal identifiable information of voters.

**Final Design Sketch**:
Base form of the State of North Carolina with all 100 counties. Our final design will include this map along with the three views
- Blue/Red Counties
- Total Registered Voters
- Total Percentage of Registered Voters that Voted
  
**Seaborn Python Library**:
This Python Library was one not convered during class. We used it for the enhanced color palette, specifically for the color-blind palette, since we wanted the data in the bar chart to be usable by all.
